Intracranial recordings from human cortex have revealed evidence of high-amplitude theta oscillations throughout the brain, including the neocortex. Although its specific role is largely unknown, the observation of human theta has begun to reveal an intriguing connection between brain oscillations and cognitive processes."

	abstract = {The DARPA Grand Challenge was a landmark in the field of robotics: a race by autonomous vehicles through 132 miles of rough, cross-country Nevada terrain that showcased exciting and unprecedented capabilities in robotic perception, navigation, and control. The event took place in October 2005, and drew teams of competitors from academia and industry, and many garage hobbyists. This book presents fifteen technical papers that are written at a level that makes them easily accessible to a broad technical audience, describing the technology behind most of the robotic vehicles that participated in this famous race. The papers describe each team's driverless vehicle, race strategy, and insights. As a whole, they present the state of the art in autonomous vehicle technology, and offer a glimpse of future technology for tomorrows driverless cars. This book will serve as an authoritative, archival source for the DARPA Grand Challenge and a must have for robotics students and researchers, since it describes the state of the art in perception, planning and control. }

	abstract = "Agents operating in the real world often have limited time available for planning their next actions. Producing optimal plans is infeasible in these scenarios. Instead, agents must be satisfied with the best plans they can generate within the time available. One class of planners well-suited to this task are anytime planners, which quickly find an initial, highly suboptimal plan, and then improve this plan until time runs out. A second challenge associated with planning in the real world is that models are usually imperfect and environments are often dynamic. Thus, agents need to update their models and consequently plans over time. Incremental planners, which make use of the results of previous planning efforts to generate a new plan, can substantially speed up each planning episode in such cases. In this paper, we present an A∗-based anytime search algorithm that produces significantly better solutions than current approaches, while also providing suboptimality bounds on the quality of the solution at any point in time. We also present an extension of this algorithm that is both anytime and incremental. This extension improves its current solution while deliberation time allows and is able to incrementally repair its solution when changes to the world model occur. We provide a number of theoretical and experimental results and demonstrate the effectiveness of the approaches in a robot navigation domain involving two physical systems. We believe that the simplicity, theoretical properties, and generality of the presented methods make them well suited to a range of search problems involving dynamic graphs."

	abstract="There are two commonly accepted paradigms for organizing intelligence in robotic vehicles, namely, reactive and deliberative. Although these paradigms are well known to researchers, there are few published examples directly comparing their development and application on similar vehicles operating in similar environments. Virginia Tech's participation, with two nearly identical vehicles in the DARPA Grand Challenge, afforded a practical opportunity for such a case study. The two Virginia Tech vehicles, Cliff and Rocky, proved capable of off-road navigation, including road following and obstacle avoidance in complex desert terrain. Under the conditions of our testing, the reactive paradigm developed for Cliff produced smoother paths and proved to be more reliable than the deliberative paradigm developed for Rocky. The deliberative method shows great promise for planning feasible paths through complex environments, but it proved unnecessarily complex for the desert road navigation problem posed by the Grand Challenge. This case study, while limited to two specific software implementations, may help to shed additional light on the tradeoffs and performance of competing approaches to machine intelligence.",

	abstract = "We survey research on self-driving cars published in the literature focusing on autonomous cars developed since the DARPA challenges, which are equipped with an autonomy system that can be categorized as SAE level 3 or higher. The architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars is typically organized into the perception system and the decision-making system. The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others. The decision-making system is commonly partitioned as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as route planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control. In this survey, we present the typical architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars. We also review research on relevant methods for perception and decision making. Furthermore, we present a detailed description of the architecture of the autonomy system of the self-driving car developed at the Universidade Federal do Espírito Santo (UFES), named Intelligent Autonomous Robotics Automobile (IARA). Finally, we list prominent self-driving car research platforms developed by academia and technology companies, and reported in the media."
